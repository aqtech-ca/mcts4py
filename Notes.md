# Notes

1. Select returns none when current node is terminal
2. repr(Class) gives the address of the object, which is unique even for the same content
3. Dependence on numpy is unwarranted
4. Nullable types => Option
5. Generics and typings partially implemented
6. Hacky issue: how can state node not have a state?
7. SimulateActions utility?
8. Gridworld coordinate system?
9. Runner, i.e. main.py?
